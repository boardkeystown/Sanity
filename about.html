                <h2>Q1: What is SANITY?</h2>
                <p>SANITY is a simple in browser tool that allows you to create and view L-Systems as an
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG" target="_blank">SVG</a>.</p>

                <p>Any L-System created in SANITY can be saved as an SVG file for later post-processing by using vector
                    art programs
                    like <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> or
                    <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html" target="_blank"> Adobe Illustrator</a>.

                <h2>Q2: What is an L-System?</h2>
                <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system" target="_blank">L-System</a>
                    or a "Lindenmayer system" is a <i> formal grammar </i> like a simple programming language
                    or script which can be used to produce fractal images.
                </p>
                <p>There are many types of L-Systems and many ways to create interpreters for them. SANITY uses an
                    iterative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle Graphics</a> interpretation
                    with a reduced subset of the
                    <a href="http://paulbourke.net/fractals/lsys/" target="_blank">Paul Bourke</a>
                    alphabet of symbols.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you would like to learn about L-Systems really work we highly recommend you read the
                    wonderful book
                    <a href="http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf"
                       target="_blank">The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants</a> as this is the best and most detailed
                    collection of information on L-Systems.

                <h2>Q3: How do I learn L-Systems?</h2>
                <p>By studying L-Systems and the relation to axioms, identities and production rules and their
                    derivations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or by simply playing around with SANITY and having a Bob Ross approach that is:
                    "There are no mistakes, just happy accidents".
